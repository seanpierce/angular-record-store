    `"Fetish club-ready EBM from ASSS's Sean Pierce, coming thru with his solo debut mini-LP on Berlin's Mannequin. Crashing in hard with the adrenalised, An-i compatible 'Immodest Force', we're plunged into the noise bath of 'Hair' and booted into cavernous warehouse headspace with the power-station techno throb of 'Memoir'.
'Motorcade' takes effect with gritty, roiling machine rhythms on the other side, pursued by the body-disassembling mechanics of 'Sutro' and the dry, jackin' aerobics of 'Torn Screen' to spend up his chips."
